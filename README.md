# Movies App

This app lets you explore movies and TV shows across three main pages, plus a detail page for each item.

Movies page: browse movie categories and switch between different types to refresh the list. Each item shows a poster thumbnail, title, popularity, and release date, with a button to open details.

TV Shows page: browse TV categories in the same way, with the list updating as you switch types. Each show displays the same core info and links to its details.

Search page: enter a title, choose a search type, and view matching results. Results follow the same card layout, and the detail button opens the full page.

Details page: shows the full poster, title, overview, popularity, and release date for the selected movie or show.
